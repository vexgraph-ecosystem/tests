// tests/vexspoke/struct/octree_test.c — owner test for struct/octree.
//
// Proves the 3D octree:
//   - construction defaults (maxDepth/maxItems 0 -> 8/8) and nullptr safety;
//   - insert only accepts points inside the root AABB (boundary inclusive);
//     an out-of-bounds point is refused and never counted;
//   - count tracks accepted inserts exactly across many inserts (leaf growth
//     and repeated subdivision included);
//   - queryRange returns exactly the points in an AABB, obeys maxCount, and
//     an empty/inverted range returns none;
//   - querySphere returns exactly the points within the radius (center hit,
//     radius-0 exact hit, misses);
//   - clear empties the tree and leaves it reusable;
//   - the AABB helpers at inclusive boundaries: containsPoint, intersects
//     (touching boxes), intersectsSphere;
//   - every entry point tolerates nullptr.

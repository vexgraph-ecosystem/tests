// Owner: TerminalColor — the packed 0xRRGGBBAA vocabulary and the one operation it
// carries, `TerminalColor_over`. It proves the "set" rule, the two exact ends (a clear
// layer shows what is behind it, an opaque one passes through bit-for-bit), the rounding
// at the half step, per-channel independence, monotonic travel as alpha rises, and that
// a real fade always comes out opaque — which is the property that makes the result safe
// to hand to a device that has no alpha channel at all.
//
// This is the arithmetic a fade is made of, so the case that earns its keep is the one
// nobody would think to write twice: opaque BLACK (0x000000FF) must survive as black and
// never be mistaken for the clear sentinel (0x00000000). They differ by one bit and
// nothing else, and getting it wrong is the difference between black text and no text.

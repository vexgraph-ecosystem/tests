// tests/lifetime/platform/platform_test.c — the platform branch _test.
//
// Proves the One File, All Platforms Law's one-spelling clause:
//   - exactly one of the six exact VEX_PLATFORM_* targets resolves per build;
//   - the coarse axes (platform, arch family, arch width) are derived from it
//     and agree with it, so a file asking a coarse question gets the same
//     answer as one asking the exact question;
//   - every raw platform macro resolves to the matching normalized branch, so a
//     file testing __APPLE__ cannot disagree with one testing VEX_PLATFORM_*;
//   - a 32-bit x86/arm or unknown target fails to build instead of taking a
//     silent wrong branch.
//
// Almost all of this proof is compile-time: the failing assertion is a build
// that does not complete. The runtime half checks the identity the build claims,
// so a header edited to lie cannot pass by compiling.
//
// This file tests the raw macros on purpose — it is the seam that proves their
// resolution. No other file may.
